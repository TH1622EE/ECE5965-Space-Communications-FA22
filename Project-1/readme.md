# ECE5965 - Satellite Communications - Project 1

## First Option
Project Title: Satellite Constellation Simulation Research
Project Due Date: Thursday, October 13, 2022
Project Goals:
1. Gain an understanding of satellite orbits and how the orbits affect communications with users on the ground
2. Understand how satellite constellations affect system costs
3. Understand how satellite constellations affect user coverage

### Details:
* Describe the use cases and/or offered services for your new (or existing) constellation.
* Decide among LEO, MEO, or GEO orbits, and explain why you picked this orbit.
* In addition, decide on what areas of the earth the constellation will cover, and why you picked this coverage.
* Choose either an existing/proposed constellation, or propose a new constellation, and explain how this constellation fits your use cases.
* Choose frequency bands for operation of the satellite links (to users and to ground stations), and discuss (at a high level) how the transmissions at the selected frequencies will be affected by atmospheric and foliage attenuation (if applicable).  Also, discuss how the frequency bands affect the antenna sizes (SV and user).
* Develop a business model for your constellation, and estimate how much it will cost to put your constellation in orbit, how much to maintain your constellation in space, how many ground stations will be needed, and how much you will need to charge users in order to maintain profitability.
* Develop a satellite constellation simulator (or use a third party tool) that will simulate satellite communications with users on the ground.  This simulator should be capable of showing satellite coverage (e.g., beam foot prints), maximum Doppler offsets for users on the ground

### Simulation Tools:
* You can use any language of your choosing (e.g., Python, Matlab/Octave, C++, etc.)
* You can use existing simulation frameworks such as, https://docs.poliastro.space/en/stable/ or https://savi.sourceforge.io/, or develop your own.

### Deliveries:
* Final Report discussing the details of your satellite/constellation simulation
* In the report include plots of beam coverage on the earth (if possible), Doppler shift as a function of satellite elevation angle, estimated number of handoffs/call (assuming calls are one of your use cases), 

### Group Effort:
1-3 persons per group, grade will be scaled accordingly.

### Extra Credit:
Enter your simulator into the open source competition described here: https://artes.esa.int/news/opportunity-opensource-satellite-constellation-simulator


## Second Option
Suggest project of your own.  Of course, it will have to do with space communications, and will have to get approval before beginning.
