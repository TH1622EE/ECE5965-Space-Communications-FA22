# ECE5965 Project 1 - Satellite Constellation Simulation Research

## Introduction
This directory contains all of the MATLAB source code to execute the various orbital specific simulations scripts as well as LaTeX source code for the creation of the IEEE formatted report and all supporting documentation.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repos to your local machine using the following command:

    `git clone https://github.com/th1622EE/ECE5965-Space-Communications-FA22.git ECE5965`

2. Run the shell script(s) for the desired constellation (i.e., LEO, MEO, HEO, GEO, or ALL) to launch MATLAB and run the sim from bash/git bash terminal using the following command(s):
   
    `cd ECE5965/Project-1 && ./runLEOsim.sh`

    `cd ECE5965/Project-1 && ./runMEOsim.sh`

    `cd ECE5965/Project-1 && ./runHEOsim.sh`

    `cd ECE5965/Project-1 && ./runGEOsim.sh`

    `cd ECE5965/Project-1 && ./runCombosim.sh`

3. Run the desired constellation (i.e., LEO, MEO, HEO, GEO, or ALL) from within MATLAB by inputting the following command into the Command Window while in the Project-1 directory:

    `leoSim`

    `meoSim`

    `heoSim`

    `geoSim`

    `comboSim`
